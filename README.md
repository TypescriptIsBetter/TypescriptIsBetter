Typescript is better than Javascript.

There's no question about it. I've lost significantly less hair programming in typescript compared to javascript.

Anyways, my current programming language capabilities are HTML, ~Javascript~ Typescript, CSS, Flutter, C++, C, Java, Php, Swift, Python, and more I'm probably forgetting.
